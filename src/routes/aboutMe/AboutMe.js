            I know most of the people are in the business for the money,
            and of course this is not a bad thing, but I am not in just for the money.
            Sometimes I think of the world that I would like to live in and then I start working to
            bring this world a tiny bit closer to this reality we currently live in.

            I believe that people who you are surrounded are shaping, in a way, the person you are and will be.
            I also believe that it should be our goal to become the best version of ourselves.
            Please let me explain myself,
            surround a person with people who are curious and you make a curious person,
            surround a person with people who are ambitious and pursue their dreams, and you
            have a person who will chase his dreams.
            <br />
            I personally want to be surrounded by people who live their dream every.single.day.
